## Installation

:::danger[Read Carefully Motherfucker]
The installer will delete any files besides it, to reserve the folder for Superiority, user content and future updates.\
Make sure you put it in an empty folder and not somewhere important like your desktop or femboy porn folder.
::: 


1. **[Click here](https://superiority.software/download)** and download Superiority.
2. Extract the folder to somewhere on your PC and run `ðŸ“„Superiority.exe`.
3. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
