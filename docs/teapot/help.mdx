## NO KV Mode
Teapot hosts a pool of keyvaults that anybody can use for free.\
So long as there is KVs in the pool, you should be good to go without one!\
No download required, they are automatically applied when you have the feature enabled.

If you were recently on NO KV mode and the KV got banned, you would need to wait a day for a new one.
